# Data Mining Assignment

### Problem Statement
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Dataset Used for Assignment - https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

#### Python libraries used for this task -

1. visualization - matplotlib, seaborn and plotly
2. data processing - pandas, numpy
3. regression - sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm


### Final Conclusions
Again Ridge (0.114) has managed to beat SVM(0.116) as the best regression model on 10-fold cross validation. And rmse of GB, XGB, and LGB have also dropped from previous holdout set's rmse.
